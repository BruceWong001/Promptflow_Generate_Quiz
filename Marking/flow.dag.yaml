    default: "When we talk about Pho, we can’t not talk about Mixed Pho – a great
      Vietnamese dish that is too hard to resist. Mixed Pho usually has two
      types: chicken and beef. Both are popular and frequently eaten by
      Vietnamese. In order to make a bowl of Mixed Pho, we need: rice noodles,
      garlic, ginger, fried peanuts, herbs, fish sauce, salt, onion, sliced and
      cooked chicken or beef, lime and some chili pepper. After being cooked,
      all of the ingredients are mixed together and the dish is ready to be
      served! According to each person’s taste, pepper or soy sauce can be added
      for more flavors. A bowl of Mixed Pho is usually around 35.000 VND –
      65.000 VND at restaurants. Many citizens like to have Mixed Pho for
      breakfast, lunch and dinner. Nowadays, Mixed Pho can be found everywhere,
      not just in Vietnam but also around the world."
